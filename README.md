# python-scripts
Collection of python scripts

When I started these scripts I had no prior knowledge of python, so their implementation might not be perfect.

- Reorganize shotwell library

  Shotwell is an application that allows you to manage pictures. I liked that you could combine multiple pictures to an
  event, but sadly the pictures on the disk cannot be ogrganized by event.
  This script reads the database created by shotwell and copies your pictures to another location. It allows to include
  the name of the event into the path.
